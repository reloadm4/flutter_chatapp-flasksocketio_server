A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application which enables point to point flawless communicatio.
Thoug lots of improvement is required.
Here the backend runs on Python's flask-socketio which is a websocket. 
Websockets have their advantage over HTTP server so we aim to connenct the present backend to our flutter client without errors.
Feel free to contribute.
